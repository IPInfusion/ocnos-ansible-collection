# IP Infusion OcNOS Ansible Collection

Ansible collection for automating IP Infusion OcNOS.

OcNOS is a network OS for White Box switch. Refer [https://www.ipinfusion.com/products/ocnos/] for the detail.

# Requirements
Ansible 2.9 or newer.

# Using OcNOS collection Modules

## Install
You can install OcNOS collection modules as either way.

To install from Galaxy,
```
$ ansible-galaxy collection install ipinfusion.ocnos
```

Also, it's possible to install it from downloaded tarball.
Once downloaded the OcNOS collection package, run ansible-galaxy command as follows
```
$ ansible-galaxy collection install ipinfusion-ocnos-1.x.x.tar.gz       
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Installing 'ipinfusion.ocnos:1.x.x' to '/home/<someones home>/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ipinfusion/ocnos'
```

During installing the modules, it installs other collections like ansible.netcommon and ansible.utils by its dependencies.
If you are installing on somewhere the internet unreachable, you may need to install the dependent collections by manual.

## Using with ansible playbook
The module name is used as ipinfusion.ocnos.<module>.

And you need some ansible vars properly.
The following shows an example of group_vars/ocnos.yml
```
ansible_connection: network_cli
ansible_network_os: ipinfusion.ocnos.ocnos
ansible_become: yes
ansible_become_method: enable
ansible_ssh_user: ocnos
ansible_ssh_pass: ocnos
```

Examble of a playbook
```
---
- hosts: ocnos

  tasks:
  - name: Test OcNOS Facts
    ipinfusion.ocnos.ocnos_facts:
      gather_subset: all
    register: result

  - name: Show Facts
    debug:
      msg: The version is {{ ansible_net_version }}. HW model is {{ ansible_net_model }}, Neighbor info is {{ ansible_net_neighbors }}
```

When you use OcNOS version 5.0 or later, please specify 'commit' variable as well for configuration switches.
The default value is 'true'.
```

- hosts: ocnos

  tasks:
  - name: Set hostname
    ipinfusion.ocnos.ocnos_config:
      lines: 'hostname helloworld'
      commit: yes
```
